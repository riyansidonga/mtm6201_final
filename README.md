# mtm6201_final
# Plant Palette Website

## Overview
This is the final project for MTM6201, a responsive website for **Plant Palette**, a restaurant. The site includes three pages: Home, Menu, and Contact, built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Hover.css. It showcases a clean, accessible, and visually appealing design optimized for various screen sizes.

## Process
1. **Planning**: Used the high-fidelity wireframe from the User Experience I course as a guide.
2. **Development**:
   - Created a project folder (`mtm6201_final`) with HTML files (`index.html`, `menu.html`, `contact.html`), a CSS file (`css/styles.css`), and an images folder.
   - Integrated **Bootstrap 5.3.2** for responsive layouts and components like the navbar and grid system.
   - Used **Hover.css** for button hover effects (e.g., `hvr-grow`).
   - Applied Google Fonts: Playfair Display (primary headings), Lora (section headings), Montserrat (content headings), and Open Sans (body/buttons).
   - Defined CSS variables for colors (Primary-1: #A1D6A5, etc.) to customize Bootstrap’s default scheme.
   - Used the `<picture>` tag with `srcset` for responsive images (large/small versions).
   - Added accessibility features: semantic HTML, ARIA roles, skip links, alt text, and keyboard navigation.
3. **Deployment**: Published to GitHub Pages at `http://your-username.github.io/mtm6201_final`.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge**: Balancing Bootstrap’s defaults with custom styles.
  - **Solution**: Used CSS variables and targeted selectors to override Bootstrap styles without breaking its functionality.
- **Challenge**: Ensuring accessibility for keyboard users.
  - **Solution**: Added skip links, focus states, and ARIA attributes; tested with keyboard navigation.
- **Challenge**: Optimizing images for performance.
  - **Solution**: Created large (1200px) and small (600px) versions, used `<picture>` for responsive delivery.

## Lessons Learned
- **Bootstrap Customization**: Learned to effectively override Bootstrap defaults using CSS variables and specific selectors.
- **Accessibility**: Gained a deeper understanding of ARIA roles, semantic markup, and keyboard navigation.
- **Responsive Images**: Mastered the `<picture>` tag and `srcset` for performance optimization.
- **Project Management**: Improved skills in organizing files, following naming conventions, and documenting processes.
